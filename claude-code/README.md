# Claude Code

This directory contains the custom configuration and slash commands that I use with Claude Code.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd claude-code
./apply.sh
```

## Commands Overview

- `/analyze` – Checklist for understanding a new project’s structure, tech stack, and AI-specific docs.
- `/commit [--no-verify] [--dry-run]` – Inspects recent commits and suggests a message following the detected convention (supports Conventional Commits and Gitmoji).
- `/create-command` – Guided template for authoring new Claude Code slash commands.
- `/troubleshoot` – Structured debugging workflow covering analysis, investigation, and resolution steps.
